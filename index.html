                        <p><strong>8:25 AM arrival at NAIA Terminal 3</strong> - stepping into Manila with excitement and anticipation. Our journey began with connecting to Philippine heritage through the <strong>Intramuros Fort Santiago Walking Tour</strong>, where we walked through centuries-old stone walls and battlements where national heroes like Dr. José Rizal were once imprisoned. The experience grounded us in our nation's history before diving into its technological future.</p>
                        
                        <p>A peaceful afternoon at <strong>Luneta Park (Rizal Park)</strong> provided the perfect transition - strolling through manicured gardens, viewing historical monuments, and appreciating the green space that serves as Manila's cultural heart. The park offered quiet moments for reflection and group bonding.</p>
                        
                        <p>Evening exploration of the massive <strong>SM Mall of Asia</strong> introduced us to Manila's scale and energy. As one of the world's largest malls, it showcased the Philippines' consumer culture and gave us our first taste of the city's vibrant commercial landscape. The sheer size helped us understand Manila as a major economic hub in Southeast Asia.</p>
